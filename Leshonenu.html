        Three names are used interchangeably, when referring to a
        particular scholar who lived in Tiberias during the tenth
        century:
      </p>
      <p>
        1) &#x2bf;&Eacute;li ben Y&#x115;huda Hannazir (= EbY). Chief
        Secretary of the Government in Tiberias
        (&ldquo;<span class="romanized-words">al-K&amacr;tib</span>&rdquo;),
        who was mentioned by David Qim&#x1e25;i (Narbonne, 12th
        century).
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Y&#x115;huda ben &#x2bf;Alan (= YbE) Hannazir
        Hakkoh&eacute;n <!-- I'm slightly uncertain about what the
        mark is above the small e but I am pretty sure it is an acute
        accent so that is how I have coded it (eacute). --> from
        Tiberias, the Jerusalemite, Head of the Y&#x115;&scaron;iva in
        Jerusalem, who was mentioned by five scholars: three Karaites
        and two Rabbanites.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) Abu Kath&imacr;r Ya&#x1e25;ya ibn Zakkariyya who was
        mentioned by the historian Mas&#x2bf;&ucirc;di, his
        contemporary in the 10th century (= AKY).
      </p>
      <p>
        1 and 3 are more easily identified with each other than 1 and
        2 and only they will be discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Qim&#x1e25;i and Mas&#x2bf;&ucirc;di, EbY lived
        and worked in Tiberias. The Geniza fragment
        T-S.Ar. 32/17 <!-- Compare with other "spellings" herein,
        e.g. "TS. Ar. 32/17" below (no dash, space after "S.") -->
        published in this article reads: &ldquo;I have been sitting
        for a long time in the markets and streets of Tiberias
        listening to Hebrew and Aramaic and their
        dialects&rdquo;. <!-- Note that I have retained the period
        outside of the double quotes as in the original even though
        this is not American style and is not followed consistently in
        the original (2 inside, 2 outside: a tie!). --> Thus, the book
        was written in Tiberias.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of his
        work <span class="romanized-title-of-work">Kit&amacr;b
        &#x2be;U&#x1e63;&umacr;l al-Lugha
        al-&#x2bf;Ibr&amacr;niyya</span> is based on the words in the
        above-mentioned fragment: &ldquo;searching the rules of the
        Hebrew language and its principles&rdquo;. <!-- Note that I
        have retained the period outside of the double quotes as in
        the original. See comment elsewhere on this. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        The book was composed before the year 932, since according to
        Mas&#x2bf;&ucirc;di, EbY died during that year. Twice we find
        the main contents of this fragment in the works of
        S&#x115;&#x2bf;adya
        Ga&#x2be;on: <span class="romanized-title-of-work">Tafs&imacr;r
        Kit&amacr;b al-Mab&amacr;di</span> (931)
        and <span class="romanized-title-of-work">Kit&amacr;b al
        Tanqi&#x1e6d;</span>. The last book seems to have been written
        during his stay in Tiberias (915&ndash;920). Thus EbY composed
        his work before the year 915.
      </p>
      <p>
        EbY received a very good Jewish and general education. He
        spoke Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. He was also conversant with
        Greek and Arabic philosophy, as we can see from his use of the
        terms &#x5d5;&#x5e6;&#x5f3;&#x5e2; and &#x5d8;&#x5d1;&#x5e2;
        in the above-mentioned Geniza fragment. He was a great scholar
        and many studied his works and were influenced by
        him. S&#x115;&#x2bf;adya Ga&#x2be;on was one of his disciples
        during his stay in Tiberias in 915&ndash;920, as is clearly
        stated by Mas&#x2bf;&ucirc;di.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Geniza fragment published in this article is
        TS. Ar. 32/17. It
        discusses <span class="romanized-words">dag&eacute;&scaron;</span>
        and <span class="romanized-words">rafe</span> of the seven
        letters &#x5d1;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;
        &#x5db;&#x5e4;&#x5e8;&#x5ea;. <!-- Unclear why there is a
        space between the first 3rd and the 4th of these letters, but
        I have retained it. --> The most important parts of this
        fragment are the rules of the double pronunciation of
        the <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span> of
        the inhabitants (men, women, and children) of Tiberias:
      </p>
      <p>
        1) The <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span>
        is pronounced
        with <span class="romanized-words">dag&eacute;&scaron;</span>
        when one of the six letters
        precedes <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span>,
        or if there is
        a <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span>
        before one of the two letters &#x5e0;&lrm;, &#x5dc;&lrm;, and either
        the <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span> or
        the preceding letter has a &scaron;&#x115;wa.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) <span class="romanized-words">R&eacute;&scaron;</span>
        is <span class="romanized-words">rafe</span> when a vowel
        appears between those eight letters and
        the <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact pronunciation of
        the <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span> is
        unclear. EbY refers to it
        as <span class="romanized-words">taqallub
        al-lis&amacr;n</span>, <!-- hyphen "hardness" is ambiguous
        since it appears at the end of a line --> &ldquo;turning over
        the tongue&rdquo; which may be assumed to be the equivalent of
        the English <span class="per-se-letter">r</span> in: right,
        ready, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equivalent Hebrew terms are mentioned by S&#x115;&#x2bf;adya
        Ga&#x2be;on, the disciple of
        EbY: <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;
        makrukh</span>
        and <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron; ghair
        makrukh</span>, which must mean the same as
        &ldquo;<span class="romanized-words">taqallub
        al-lis&amacr;n</span>.&rdquo; <!-- Note that I have retained
        the period inside of the double quotes as in the original. See
        comment elsewhere on this. -->
      <p>
        The pronunciation of
        both <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;</span>
        and the <span class="romanized-words">r&eacute;&scaron;
        rafe</span> was alive during the ninth&mdash;eleventh
        centuries: <!-- Em dash in original seems incorrect but I have
        reproduced it faithfully, nonetheless --> (from Mo&scaron;e
        ben A&scaron;er Yona ibn Djana&#x1e25;). In the twelfth
        century the author of the T&imacr;dj&amacr;n in Yemen states:
        &ldquo;This is not known in our country.&rdquo; <!-- Note that
        I have retained the period inside of the double quotes as in
        the original. See comment elsewhere on this. -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Of equal importance is the information we obtain about the
        research methods of this grammarian in Tiberias. It is now
        clear that P. Kahle was mistaken in his views of the work of
        the Tiberian Masoretes. He saw them as revolutionaries,
        creators and reconstructors without a sense of
        tradition. According to this Geniza fragment, the Masoretes
        worked on the basis of experiments with the living tradition
        of his <!-- "their" intended? --> compatriots in Tiberias.
