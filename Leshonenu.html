        N. Allony: Eli ben Yehuda Hannazir and his Treatise "Kitab
        Usul al-Lugha al-Ibraniyya" (pp. 187--209)
      </p>
      <p>
        Three names are used interchangeably, when referring to a
        particular scholar who lived in Tiberias during the tenth
        century:
      </p>
      <p>
        1) Eli ben Yehuda Hannazir (= EbY). Chief Secretary of the
        Government in Tiberias ("al-Katib"), who was mentioned by
        David Qimhi (Narbonne, 12th century).
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Yehuda ben Alan (= YbE) Hannazir Hakkohen from Tiberias,
        the Jerusalemite, Head of the Yesiva in Jerusalem, who was
        mentioned by five scholars: three Karaites and two Rabbanites.
      </p>
      <p>
        3) Abu Kathir Yahya ibn Zakkariyya who was mentioned by the
        historian Masuda, his contemporary in the 10th century (=
        AKY).
      </p>
      <p>
        1 and 3 are more easily identified with each other than 1 and
        2 and only they will be discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Qimhi and Masudi, EbY lived and worked in
        Tiberias. The Geniza fragment T-S.Ar. 32/17 <!-- Compare with
        other "spellings" herein, e.g. "TS. Ar. 32/17" below (no dash,
        space after "S.") --> published in this article reads: "I have
        been sitting for a long time in the markets and streets of
        Tiberias listening to Hebrew and Aramaic and their
        dialects". <!-- Note that I have retained the "period outside
        of double quotes" style of the original. --> Thus, the book
        was written in Tiberias.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of his work <span class="title-of-work">Kitab
        Usul al-Lugha al-Ibraniyya</span>is based on the words in the
        above-mentioned fragment: "searching the rules of the Hebrew
        language and its principles".
      </p>
      <p>
        The book was composed before the year 932, since according to
        Masudi, EbY died during that year. Twice we find the main
        contents of this fragment in the works of Seadya
        Gaon: <span class="title-of-work">Tafsir Kitab
        al-Mabadi</span> (931) and <span class="title-of-work">Kitab
        al Tanqit</span>. The last book seems to have been written
        during his stay in Tiberias (915--920). Thus EbY composed his
        work before the year 915.
      </p>
      <p>
        EbY received a very good Jewish and general education. He
        spoke Hebrew, Aramaic, and Arabic. He was also conversant with
        Greek and Arabic philosophy, as we can see from his use of the
        terms xxx and xxx in the above-mentined Geniza fragment. He
        was a great scholar and many studied his works and were
        influenced by him. Seadya Gaon was one of his disciples during
        his stay in Tiberias in 915--920, as is clearly stated by
        Masudi.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Geniza fragment published in this article is
        TS. Ar. 32/17. It
        discusses <span class="romanized-words">dages</span>
        and <span class="romanized-words">rafe</span> of the seven
        letters xxx xxxx. The most important parts of this fragment
        are the rules of the double pronunciation of
        the <span class="romanized-words">res</span> of the inhabitants
        (men, women, and children) of Tiberias:
      </p>
      <p>
        1) The resxxx is pronounced with dagesxxx when one of the six
        letters precedes resxxx, or if there is a resxxx before one of
        the two letters nunxxx, lamedxxx, and either the resxxx or the
        preceding letter has a sewaxxx.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) Resxxx is rafexxx when a vowel appears between those eight
        letters and the resxxx.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exact pronunciation of the resxxx is unclear. EbY refers
        to it as <span class="romanized-words">taqallub
        al-lisan</span>, <!-- hyphen "hardness" is ambiguous since it
        appears at the end of a line --> "turning over the tongue"
        which may be assumed to be the equivalent of the
        English <span class="per-se-letter">r</span> in: right, ready,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equivalent Hebrew terms are mentioned by Seadya Gaon, the
        disciple of EbY: res makrukh and res ghair makrukh, which must
        mean the same as "<span class="romanized-words">taqallub
        al-lisan</span>." <!-- Note that here the period appears
        inside the double quote in the original, unlike many (but not
        all) other cases -->
      <p>
        The pronunciation of both res and the res rafe was alive
        during the ninth---eleventh centuries: <!-- Em dash in
        original seems incorrect but I have reproduced it faithfully,
        nonetheless --> (from Mose ben Aser Yona ibn Djanah). In the
        twelfth century the other of the Tidjan in Yemen states: "This
        is not known in our country." <!-- Note that here the period
        appears inside the double quote in the original, unlike many
        (but not all) other cases -->
      </p>
      <p>
        Of equal importance is the information we obtain about the
        research methods of this grammarian in Tiberias. It is now
        clear that P. Kahle was mistaken in his views of the work of
        the Tiberian Masoretes. He saw them as revolutionaries,
        creators and reconstructors without a sense of
        tradition. According to this Geniza fragment, the Masoretes
        worked on the basis of experiments with the living tradition
        of his <!-- "their" intended? --> compatriots in Tiberias.
