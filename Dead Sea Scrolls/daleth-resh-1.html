    <h1>The <em>daleth</em> and the <em>resh</em>, part 1 of 2</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Here's what the Hebrew letters <em>daleth</em>
    and <em>resh</em> look like.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <font size="7">רד</font>
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      With that in mind, consider the following excerpt about Isaiah 33.8.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          The RSV, NRSV, NAB, and NIV follow 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> in
          reading

          <blockquote>
            <em>ʾdym</em> [‘ê·ḏîm] [עֵדִ֔ים]
            [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/edim_5707.htm">concordance</a>]
            “witnesses”
          </blockquote>

          instead of the MT

          <blockquote>
            <em>ʾrym</em> [‘ā·rîm] [עָרִ֔ים]
            [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/arim_5892.htm">concordance</a>]
            “cities.”
          </blockquote>

          “Witnesses” seems appropriate to the meaning of the
          passage, and the interchange of <em>resh</em>
          for <em>daleth</em> is understandable in light of the similarity
          of the letter shapes. The NJV also calls attention to this
          reading in a footnote.

    <p>
      This got me thinking, how should one go about writing a sacred
      text in a way that avoids such problems?
    </p>

    <p>
      Or, more generally, how should one go about writing a text that
      needs to be transmitted with high fidelity,
      i.e. faithfully. Sacred texts are just a specific example of
      this. The situation reminds me of an old FedEx slogan:
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10%" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td>
          When it Absolutely, Positively has to be there overnight.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      So, sacred texts are those where it absolutely, positively must
      be copied right. Yet, historically, they have fallen far short
      of this. At least, this is true of the sacred texts of Judaism,
      which are the only ones I know anything about.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following is a rambling set of comments on the topic of
      faithful transmission of text. I'd like to be able to call it
      something more profound, like an "extended meditation," but it
      is really just a ramble. As the title suggests, it is the first
      of what I hope will be a two-part whole.
    </p>

    <h2>Avoid homoglyphs</h2>

    <p>
      The first rule of faithful transmission is "avoid homoglyphs."
      Well, really it should be "avoid homoglyphs and
      near-homoglyphs," but that isn't as catchy. Anyway, it is just a
      fancy way of saying "use letterforms that look different."
    </p>

    <h3>Hebrew homoglyphs</h3>

    <p>Hebrew is littered with near-homoglyphs. We've already seen the
      issue with <em>daleth</em> and <em>resh</em>; here it is again,
      along with various other issues.
      </p>

            <font size="7">נג כב עצ זןו רדך סם </font>

    <p>A more detailed presentation of these issues is available on
      the following web page.  (Note that it shows Sofit and Fey Sofit
      in their cursive form. Their printed forms are not easily
      confused.)

            By the way, this "Hebrew for Christians" site is an
            example of a general pattern:

          <blockquote>
            Some of the best resources for studying the Tanakh are for
            studying the Old Testament.
          </blockquote>

            Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, or just a thing,
            neither good nor bad, I will perhaps opine on in another blog
            post. But I will remark here that it feels a little strange to
            me. But that feeling itself is a little strange, since when I
            step back and think about it, it is not surprising that it
            should be the case. Our sacred texts our sacred to them,
            too. And, while numbers don't tell all, I'll just point out that
            there are something like 150 times as many Christians as Jews in
            the world.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>English homoglyphs</h3>
    <p>
      Anyway, back to homoglyphs (and near-homoglyphs). To be fair to
      Hebrew, English is not immune to this problem. Or, rather, the
      Latin alphabet and Arabic digits are not immune to this
      problem. For example consider the following characters.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>1 (the digit one)</li>
      <li>I (the letter capital I as in India) (henceforth "CI")</li>
      <li>l (the letter lowercase el) (henceforth "LL") </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Putting all three together, you get "1 I l."  How much these
      differ depends on whatever font is operative. For some
      edification and entertainment, I recommend typing "1 I l" in at
      one of the following sites:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <a href="http://flippingtypical.com">flippingtypical.com</a><br>
        <a href="http://wordmark.it">wordmark.it</a>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10%">
      <tr>
        <td>NOTATIONAL<br>ASIDE</td>
        <td>
          I chose "India" as an example of a word starting with I
          since that's the choice of
          the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">NATO
          phonetic alphabet</a>, which is designed to give letters
          different-sounding names, solving a problem analogous to the
          one we are discussing here.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Are homoglyphs "wrong"?</h3>
    <p>
      I think we have to let sans serif fonts off easy on the CI/LL
      distinction. Though the distinction can be made with full
      strokes, not just serifs, I feel that it is not really in the
      charter of a sans serif font to have to make distinctions like
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, we can't say that any font is wrong if it fails
      to make one or more of these distinctions. Fonts serve a variety
      of purposes; their design goals span concerns of form, function,
      and the great gray area in between. Many of these goals are at
      odds with each other, and hence trade-offs must be made. In the
      service of one goal, another goal may be sacrificed, or at least
      compromised. For example, if simplicity of letterform is allowed
      to trump distinctness of letterform, then perhaps one, CI, and
      LL would be allowed to be very similar or even the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      That having been said, for most purposes, distinctness of
      letterform is a very important goal for a font. Thus a font
      intended for general use should give this goal great weight in
      making its design trade-offs.
    </p>

    <h3>One and CI</h3>
    <p>
      My particular interest is the one/CI distinction. The most
      common problem here is a one that looks like CI. The
      above sites allowed me to quickly identify the following fonts
      on my computer as offenders in this area.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Hoefler Text</li><!-- xxx insert example image -->
      <li>Big Caslon</li><!-- xxx insert example image -->
    </ul>

    <p>
      A Roman-style one (henceforth "R1"), i.e. a one that looks like
      CI, is common as part of what are called old-style numerals or
      old-style figures (OSF). Such a one may be distinguishable (with
      effort) from CI since it is usually only x-height. Even then,
      when mixed with a small caps CI, the problem may persist. This
      might seem an obscure situation, but the use of small caps for
      acronyms is a somewhat common style.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/blog/gores_choice">Here's the
        story of how Vice President Al Gore caused the one in the
        Brioni font to be changed from Roman to Arabic to make it
        easily distinguishable from CI.</a>
    </p>

    <h3>Roman ones and the Great Isaiah Scroll</h3>
    <p>
      Let's get back to the sacred. Strangely enough, my first
      experience of one/CI confusion happened while reading about some
      famous <em>daleth/resh</em> confusions of more than two thousand
      years ago! The <em>very</em> perceptive reader may have noticed
      the opportunity for one/CI confusion in the prickly-looking
      abbrevation "1QIsa" that appears in my opening quote.
    </p>

    <p>
      "1QIsa" is an interesting opportunity for confusion. On the
      positive side, it has a one and a CI, making slight differences
      between the glyphs easier to see than if they appeared
      independently and the reader had to find and compare far-flung
      examples. Also on the positive side, many readers would know,
      from context, that the third glyph is a CI since it begins an
      abbreviation for Isaiah. Slightly fewer, but still many readers
      would know, from context, that the glyph before the Q is
      supposed to represent a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      But here begins the real problem. When the one resembles a CI,
      is the reader to infer that the convention is to use Roman
      rather than Arabic numerals? For the trivial case of the number
      one, it doesn't really matter, since they represent the same
      thing. But for the case of the number eleven, confusion could be
      serious, since R1 glyphs would make eleven look like the Roman
      numeral representation for two. And, as it turns out, there was
      a Cave 11 at Qumran, containing, among other things, the Great
      Temple Scroll (11QT<sup>a</sup>).
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's see how the Great Isaiah Scroll is referred to in the NJPS
      translation of Prophets (Nevi'im) that was first published in
      1978 (ISBN 0-8276-0096-8). (This is not the first publication of
      its translation of Isaiah; that was in 1973.)
    </p>

    <div align="center">

    </div>

    <p>
      First, we should note that the NJPS Prophets abbreviates Isaiah
      to just "Is" as opposed to the more standard "Isa."  Perhaps
      that standard had not been established yet, and in any case
      that's not our issue here.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our issue here is that its typesetting of "1QIs" visits the
      whole gamut of the one/CI/LL confusion. The one is represented
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>confusingly, an R1</li>
      <li>incorrectly, as LL</li>
      <li>correctly, as an Arabic one (henceforth "A1")</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The CI is represented
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>incorrectly, as an LL</li>
      <li>correctly, as a CI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Below are scans of examples of its different settings of
      "1QIs<sup>a</sup>." The page numbers and the representations of
      one and CI are listed in the first row. Apologies that these are
      bilevel rather than grayscale images.

    <p>
      This was all fixed, to A1/CI, in the 1985 NJPS Tanakh. More
      generally, the 1985 Tanakh moved to using A1 rather than R1 in
      footnotes.
    </p>

    <p>
      And then came the digital age.
    </p>

    <p>
      What promise it offered, and continues to offer! Yet, what
      typographic barbarisms it has facilitated. I suppose that only
      from great heights can great falls happen. Another way I've seen
      it well-put is:

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Don't get me wrong, my Kindle version of the NJPS Tanakh is one
      of my prized possessions, inasmuch as something so intangible
      can be thought of as a possession. But somehow one/CI confusion
      in "1QIs" crept back in, with a vengeance. In particular, the
      one is usually represented as a CI.

          In typical great heights/great falls fashion, Kindle
          locations offer citations of intriguingly high resolution,
          but all footnotes have been converted to endnotes, and thus
          all Isaiah footnotes appear to be on the last page of
          Isaiah, 762. Within the hyper-linked Kindle world, this
          doesn't really matter. For citations that "work" for the
          printed version, you need to follow the endnote's hyperlink
          "backward" to find the real page.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      In the Kindle edition, how can we know whether the one is being
      represented by a CI or an R1?  Well, for one thing it is
      visually identical to other CI glyphs, but, more deeply, if you
      copy and paste it, it is a CI; and if you search for IQI
      (CI-Q-CI), you'll find those instances that use it.
    </p>

    <p>
      An important consequence of this is that if you search for 1QI
      (one-Q-CI), you <em>won't</em> find the IQI (CI-Q-CI)
      instances. And here we really find form spilling over into
      function. So far all my complaints about the typesetting of
      "1QIs" could be dismissed as the whinings of an aesthete with
      too much time on his hands. I would mostly disagree with this
      characterization, but would have to admit that function was only
      impaired, not destroyed by these problems. If we narrowly define
      function as transmitting the meaning, "Isaiah manuscript from
      Cave 1 at Qumran," then these problems probably did not destroy
      function for most readers. They probably just made it more
      difficult to decode this meaning, i.e. they only impaired
      function.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the digital version adds (or should add) a new function: the
      ability to search. And this was not just impaired but destroyed
      by the misrepresentation of one as CI.

          When one is represented as one in the Kindle edition, it
          shows up as an Arabic, yet old-style, figure. This and other
          research leads me to believe that Georgia is the font used
          by the Kindle Reader for Mac. Or at least it is the font
          used when a serif, proportional font is requested. Note that
          you can't easily change fonts on any Kindle-reading
          platform. That's why I said it is "the font," not "the
          default font." On Kindle hardware, the font seems to be PMN
          Caecilia, which has a lining one, i.e. a non-old-style
          one. Some fonts may have an option for both lining and
          old-style figures, and perhaps even an option for both an
          Arabic and Roman old-style figure for 1. I'm not sure if
          either of these fonts do, but the relevant question here is
          what does their default one look like.

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>
      If you have the luxury of making up your own alphabet, avoid
      homoglyphs. This luxury is rarely available; the only recent
      example I can think of is the invention of the Klingon
      alphabet. I wonder how distinguishable its glyphs are.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10%">

        <td>DIGRESSION</td>
        <td>
          Another "I wonder ..." about a recent example: did anything
          analogous to <em>daleth/resh</em> confusion ever happen with
          the Book of Mormon?
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Back to obvious conclusions: if you, like most of us, are stuck
      using someone else's alphabet, choose your fonts so as to avoid
      homoglyphs. For example, avoid fonts with Roman ones if the text
      you're setting might use them in a way that would cause
      confusion. Perhaps you don't need to avoid the font altogether
      if it provides an Arabic one as an alternative.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, let's zoom out to a theological question: if Isaiah's
      words are holy, why didn't G-d give him a better alphabet to
      record them in?
    </p>

    <p>
      My suggestion is, the Hebrew alphabet is no more the alphabet of
      G-d than the Hebrew language is the language of G-d. Indeed
      problems like <em>daleth/resh</em> confusion serve a useful
      purpose. They remind us that we are reading holy words, not
      G-d's words. Holy words bring us closer to G-d, but they are
      written in man's imperfect alphabets, and in man's imperfect
      languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      To me, the very notion of "G-d's words" unacceptably diminishes
      G-d by seeing him as acting within the limits of language and
      therefore possibly constrained by language.
    </p>

    <p>
      Like anyone else (perhaps more so), I can't claim to know much
      about G-d.  But I'm pretty sure he is without limits. (So I'm
      also pretty sure he is not a "he" or a "she"!) And I'm pretty
      sure that if G-d had an alphabet, we surely could not read it.
