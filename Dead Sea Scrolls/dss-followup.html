    <h1>More on Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This post is another follow-up to my post,
      <a href="http://dencklatronic.blogspot.com/2012/09/qumran-isaiah-and-njps.html">
        "Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS,"</a> covering some possible
      unnoted Qumran influences.</p>

    <p>In my earlier post, I said</p>

    <blockquote>
      It is possible that the Qumran influenced the NJPS Isaiah in
      ways that were not noted, but that is more difficult or even
      impossible to know.
    </blockquote>

    <p>But it occurred to me later that I might be able to find some
      unnoted influences by looking at verses where other translations
      were influenced. In particular, I might be able to find some
      unnoted influences by looking at all verses mentioned in
      Scanlin, since his coverage of the NJPS (which he calls the NJV)
      is not exhaustive.</p>

    <p>Doing this, indeed I did discover at least one unnoted
      influence, but I also discovered some other things of interest
      in these verses, which I allowed myself to digress into.</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>

    <p>The only verse in which I'm pretty sure there is an unnoted
      Qumran influence is 8.2. Possible influences include 19.18,
      45.2, and 45.8. Things of non-Qumran interest show up in 14.30
      and 33.8.</p>

    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <h3><a href="http://biblos.com/isaiah/8-2.htm">Isaiah 8.2</a></h3>

    <p>The NJPS appears to be using the imperative form of 1QIsa-a
      without note.</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">NJPS<br>page<br>632</td>
        <td>
          [[8.1] The LORD said to me, “Get yourself a large sheet
          and write on it in common script ‘For
          Maher-shalal-hash-baz’;] and call reliable witnesses, the
          priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to witness
          for Me.”

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 127).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The MT and 4QIsa-e have a first person future verb for "I will
      call as witness(es)," [wə·’ā·‘î·ḏāh] [וְאָעִ֣ידָה]
      [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/veaidah_5749.htm">concordance</a>]
      while 1QIsa-a reads <em>wh`d,</em> an imperative form, "and have
      it attested," as in NRSV. The NIV translates the MT (with
      4QIsa-e), "And I will call in Uriah the priest and Zechariah
      ... as reliable witnesses for me."  Some translations translate
      the consonants of the MT, but change the vowel of the first
      letter from <em>w<sup>e</sup></em> [wə] [וְ] to <em>wa,</em> [wā]
      [וָ] changing it to the past tense
      [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/vaaidah_5749.htm">concordance</a>]. The
      future tense of the NIV, however, is a legitimate tense shift in
      prophetic literature, reflecting the prophet's certainty that he
      will be the agent of God's message. In any case, it does not
      seem necessary to resort to the 1QIsa-a reading.
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a href="http://biblos.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14.30</a></h3>

    <p>Here the NJPS is not influenced by Qumran, in that it chooses
      "it will slay" instead of "I will slay." But, in a footnote, it
      offers an emendation of unspecified source.

      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td rowspan="2">NJPS<br>page<br>648</td>

        <tr>

          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 128).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The RSV and NRSV follow 1QIsa-a in translating, "I will slay,"
      instead of "he/it will slay." The Isaiah scroll seems to
      better fit the context in which this passage is preceded by
      another first person singular verb. Among the ancient
      versions, only the Latin agrees with 1QIsa-a. Burrows finds
      the Qumran reading quite convincing (1955:307), and the
      NEB/REB concur. However, HOTTP prefers the MT, explaining the
      shift to third person as a reference back to "the venomous
      serpent" of 14:29.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Primarily, the emendation in the NJPS note substitutes
      offspring for stock and venom for famine.  But, secondarily, the
      emendation would bring the last two lines into "person
      agreement."  I.e. it would read
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      It shall kill [...]<br>
      And it shall slay [...]
    </blockquote>

    It is perhaps interesting to note that the 1QIsa-a variant also
    has such "person agreement," albeit in the opposite direction
    (changing both lines to first person), i.e.

    <blockquote>
      I will kill [...]<br>
      I will slay [...]
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a href="http://biblos.com/isaiah/19-18.htm">Isaiah 19.18</a></h3>

    <p>
      It is unclear whether one or more of the "many Hebrew
      manuscripts" referred to in the footnote is from
      Qumran. I.e. there is some Masoretic as well as Qumran support
      for "Sun City."
    </p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [footnote:] Meaning uncertain. Many
          Heb. mss. read <em>ḥeres,</em> [חֶרֶס] “sun,” which may refer
          to Heliopolis, i.e., Sun City, in Egypt. Targum’s “Beth
          Shemesh” (cf. Jer. 43.13) has the same meaning.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 129).</p>

    <blockquote>
      In a note, NIV cites Q (= Qumran) along with some MSS of the
      MT in support of the reading "City of the Sun." Other
      versions, including RSV and NRSV, read "City of the Sun" in
      the text without adding a textual note. This follows the
      general practice of many translations that do not cite textual
      variants if there is any manuscript support in the Masoretic
      tradition.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      In the body text, the NJPS has chosen to transliterate rather
      than translate "Heres," whereas most Bibles choose to translate,
      either to "destruction" (from הֶ֫רֶס)
      (<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/2041.htm">concordance</a>)
      or “sun” (from חֶרֶס). It is slightly surprising that the NJPS
      does not note the possibility of "destruction."
    </p>

    <h3><a href="http://biblos.com/isaiah/33-8.htm">Isaiah 33.8</a></h3>

    <p>
      I mentioned this verse in
      my <a href="http://dencklatronic.blogspot.com/2012/09/qumran-isaiah-and-njps.html">original
      post</a> but bring it up again here because the note is odd. It
      is odd because the alternative that 1QIsa-a offers for "cities"
      is usually understood to be "witnesses," not "a pact."
    </p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 130).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The RSV, NRSV, NAB, and NIV follow 1QIsa-a in
      reading <em>ʾdym</em> [‘ê·ḏîm] [עֵדִ֔ים]
      [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/edim_5707.htm">concordance</a>]
      “witnesses” instead of the MT <em>ʾrym</em> [‘ā·rîm] [עָרִ֔ים]
      [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/arim_5892.htm">concordance</a>]
      “cities.”  “Witnesses” seems appropriate to the meaning of the
      passage, and the interchange of <em>resh</em>
      for <em>daleth</em> is understandable in light of the similarity
      of the letter shapes. The NJV also calls attention to this
      reading in a footnote.
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a href="http://biblos.com/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45.2</a></h3>

    <p>
      Here the NJPS implicitly disavows Qumran influence, in that the note
      says that the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain, and only the
      meaning of the MT Hebrew is uncertain. Yet, the NJPS chooses
      "hills," which is close to the "mountains" of 1QIsa-a.

          And cut down iron bars.

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 130).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The second line in the MT reads, "I will level the
      swellings/rough places." The Hebrew word rendered "swellings"
      [wa·hă·ḏū·rîm] [וַהֲדוּרִ֖ים]
      [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/vahadurim_1921.htm">concordance</a>]
      occurs only here in the OT. 1QIsa-a reads <em>hrrym</em>
      "mountains," which is followed by the NIV, NAB, and RSV/NRSV.
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a href="http://biblos.com/isaiah/45-8.htm">Isaiah 45.8</a></h3>

    <p>
      The NJPS notes no Qumran influence, yet its use of "sprout" instead
      of something like "be brought forth" is the kind of thing one would
      expect from Qumran influence.
    </p>

      <tr>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 130).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The RSV and NRSV follow the 1QIsa-a reading <em>wyprch</em>
      [ויפרח] for the MT <em>wyprw,</em>
      [ויפרו <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/veyifru_6509.htm">concordance</a>]
      a difference of only one letter, <em>cheth</em> [ח]
      for <em>waw,</em> [ו] which yields the translation, "that
      salvation may sprout forth [RSV]/spring up [NRSV]," instead of
      "that they may bring forth salvation." The NAB follows the same
      Qumran reading. The NEB and GNB, in dynamic equivalent
      renderings, demonstrate that both the MT and Qumran express a
      common idea. The NEB translates, "that it may bear the fruit of
      salvation," and the GNB has "[it] will blossom with freedom and
      justice." Neither translation has a textual note here. HOTTP
      prefers the Qumran reading, but as can be seen, there may be
      little difference in the translation of the MT or Qumran.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To me, the most notable thing has nothing to do with Qumran, but
      rather that translations that are part of Christian Bibles seem
      to universally use "salvation" where the NJPS uses "triumph."
      Whether it is brought forth or sprouts seems secondary.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is just speculation, but I wonder if what we're seeing here
      is a case of harmonization of Isaiah with Christian ideas. Or,
      on the other hand, a reluctance on the part of the NJPS to use a
      word like "salvation" that has such strong Christian resonances.
    </p>

    <p>
      For what it's worth, the NJPS does not shy away from using the
      word "salvation," for instance in the following four verses of
      Isaiah.
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td>49.6</td>
        <td>
          For He has said:<br>
          “It is too little that you should be My servant<br>

          And restore the survivors of Israel:<br>
          I will also make you a light of nations,<br>
          That My <em>salvation</em> may reach the ends of the earth.”

          I created you and appointed you a covenant people—<br>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>56.1</td>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Here's a possible explanation for the use of "salvation" in the
      verses above as opposed to its non-use in 45:8. In the verses
      above, "salvation" is being used as the translation of words
      rooted in יְשׁוּעָה (yeshuah)
      (<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/3444.htm">concordance</a>),
      whereas in 45:8, the word is rooted in יֵ֫שַׁע (yesha)
      (<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/3468.htm">concordance</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The only verse in which I'm pretty sure there is an unnoted
      Qumran influence is 8.2. I discovered some other interesting
      stuff along the way, though.
    </p>
