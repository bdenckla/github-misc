    <h1>More on Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This post is another follow-up to
      <a href="http://dencklatronic.blogspot.com/2012/09/qumran-isaiah-and-njps.html">
        Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</a>, covering some possible
      Qumran influences in the NJPS that were not noted in the
      NJPS.</p>

    <p>In my earlier post, I said</p>

    <blockquote>
      It is possible that the Qumran influenced the NJPS Isaiah in
      ways that were not noted, but that is more difficult or even
      impossible to know.
    </blockquote>

    <p>But it occurred to me later that I might be able to find some
      unnoted influences simply by looking at verses where other
      translations were influenced. In particular, I might be able to
      find some unnoted influences by looking at all verses mentioned
      in Scanlin, since his coverage of NJPS (which he calls NJV) is
      not exhaustive.</p>

    <p>This is what I did, and indeed I did discover at least one
      unnoted influence, but I also discovered some other things of
      interest in these verses, which I allowed myself to digress
      into.</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>

    <p>The only verse in which I'm pretty sure there is an unnoted
      Qumran influence is 8.2. Possible influences include 19.18, 45.2,
      and 45.8.</p>

    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <h3>Isaiah 8.2</h3>

    <p>The NJPS appears to be using the imperative form of 1QIsa-a
      without note.</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td width="50%">NJPS page 632</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [[8.1] The LORD said to me, “Get yourself a large sheet
          and write on it in common script ‘For
          Maher-shalal-hash-baz’;] and call reliable witnesses, the
          priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to witness
          for Me.”
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [no footnotes relevant to the issue at hand]
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>


    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 127).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The MT and 4QIsa-e have a first person future verb for "I will
      call as witness(es)," while 1QIsa-a reads <em>wh`d,</em> an
      imperative form, "and have it attested," as in NRSV. The NIV
      translates the MT (with 4QIsa-e), "And I will call in Uriah
      the priest and Zechariah ... as reliable witnesses for me."
      Some translations translate the consonants of the MT, but
      change the vowel of the first letter
      from <em>w</em><sup>e</sup> to <em>wa,</em>
      changing it to the past tense. The future tense of the NIV,
      however, is a legitimate tense shift in prophetic literature,
      reflecting the prophet's certainty that he will be the agent
      of God's message. In any case, it does not seem necessary to
      resort to the 1QIsa-a reading.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 14.30</h3>

    <p>Here the NJPS is not influenced by Qumran, in that it chooses
      "it will slay" instead of "I will slay." But, in a footnote, it
      offers an emendation of unspecified source.

      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">NJPS page 648</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [[14.29] Rejoice not, all Philistia,<br>
            Because the staff of him that beat you is broken.<br>
            For from the stock of a snake there sprouts an asp,<br>
            A flying seraph branches out from it.]<br>
            The first-born of the poor shall graze<br>
            And the destitute lie down secure.<br>
            <em>I will kill your stock by famine,</em><br>
            And it shall slay the very last of you.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [footnote:] Emendation yields “It shall kill your
            offspring with its venom <em>(zar‘ekh berosho)</em>.”
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 128).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The RSV and NRSV follow 1QIsa-a in translating, "I will slay,"
      instead of "he/it will slay." The Isaiah scroll seems to
      better fit the context in which this passage is preceded by
      another first person singular verb. Among the ancient
      versions, only the Latin agrees with 1QIsa-a. Burrows finds
      the Qumran reading quite convincing (1955:307), and the
      NEB/REB concur. However, HOTTP prefers the MT, explaining the
      shift to third person as a reference back to "the venomous
      serpent" of 14:29.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Primarily the emendation substitutes offspring for stock and
      venom for famine.  But, secondarily, the emendation would bring
      the last two lines into "person agreement."  I.e. it would read
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      It shall kill [...]<br>
      And it shall slay [...]
    </blockquote>

    It is perhaps interesting to note that the 1QIsa-a variant also
    has such "person agreement," albeit in the opposite direction
    (changing both lines to first person), i.e.

    <blockquote>
      I will kill [...]<br>
      I will slay [...]
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 19.18</h3>

    <p>It is unclear whether one or more of the "many Hebrew manuscripts"
      referred to in the footnote is from Qumran. I.e. there is some
      Masoretic as well as Qumran support for "Sun City."</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td width="50%">NJPS page 656</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          In that day, there shall be several towns in the land of Egypt
          speaking the language of Canaan and swearing loyalty to the
          LORD of Hosts; one shall be called Town of <em>Heres</em>.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [footnote:] Meaning uncertain. Many
          Heb. mss. read <em>ḥeres,</em> “sun,” which may refer to
          Heliopolis, i.e., Sun City, in Egypt. Targum’s “Beth Shemesh”
          (cf. Jer. 43.13) has the same meaning.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 129).</p>

    <blockquote>
      In a note, NIV cites Q (= Qumran) along with some MSS of the
      MT in support of the reading "City of the Sun." Other
      versions, including RSV and NRSV, read "City of the Sun" in
      the text without adding a textual note. This follows the
      general practice of many translations that do not cite textual
      variants if there is any manuscript support in the Masoretic
      tradition.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 33.8</h3>

    <p>
      I mentioned this verse in my original post but bring it up again
      here because the note is odd. Translations influenced by 1QIsa-a use
      <em>ʾdym</em> “witnesses” instead of the MT <em>ʾrym</em> “cities.”
      Yet the note in NJPS says that 1QIsa-a reads "A pact," not
      "witnesses."
    </p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td width="50%">NJPS page 685</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Highways are desolate,<br>
          Wayfarers have ceased.<br>
          A covenant has been renounced,<br>
          <em>Cities</em> rejected<br>
          Mortal man despised.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [footnote:] 1QIs-a reads “A pact.”
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Isaiah 45.2</h3>

    <p>
      Here the NJPS implicitly disavows Qumran influence, in that the note
      says that the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain, and only the
      meaning of the MT Hebrew is uncertain. Yet, the NJPS chooses
      "hills," which is close to the "mountains" of 1QIsa-a.
    </p>

      <tr>
        <td width="50%">NJPS page 714</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          I will march before you<br>
          And level <em>the hills that loom up;</em><br>
          I will shatter doors of bronze<br>
          And cut down iron bars.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [footnote:] Meaning of Heb. uncertain.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 130).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The second line in the MT reads, "I will level the
      swellings/rough places." The Hebrew word rendered "swellings"
      occurs only here in the OT. 1QIsa-a reads <em>hrrym</em>
      "mountains," which is followed by the NIV, NAB, and RSV/NRSV.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 45.8</h3>

    <p>
      The NJPS notes no Qumran influence, yet its use of "sprout" instead
      of something like "be brought forth" is the kind of thing one would
      expect from Qumran influence.
    </p>


    <table border="1">
      <tr>
        <td width="50%">NJPS page 714</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          Pour down, O skies, from above!<br>
          Let the heavens rain down victory!<br>
          Let the earth open up and triumph sprout,<br>
          Yes, let vindication spring up:<br>
          I the LORD have created it.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          [no footnote]
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 130).</p>

    <blockquote>
      The RSV and NRSV follow the 1QIsa-a reading <em>wyprch</em>
      for the MT <em>wyprw,</em> a difference of only one
      letter, <em>cheth</em> for <em>waw,</em> which yields the
      translation, "that salvation may sprout forth [RSV]/spring up
      [NRSV]," instead of "that they may bring forth salvation." The
      NAB follows the same Qumran reading. The NEB and GNB, in
      dynamic equivalent renderings, demonstrate that both the MT
      and Qumran express a common idea. The NEB translates, "that it
      may bear the fruit of salvation," and the GNB has "[it] will
      blossom with freedom and justice." Neither translation has a
      textual note here. HOTTP prefers the Qumran reading, but as
      can be seen, there may be little difference in the translation
      of the MT or Qumran.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      To me, the most notable thing has nothing to do with Qumran, but
      rather that translations that are part of Christian bibles seem to
      universally use "salvation" where NJPS uses "triumph." Whether it is
      brought forth or sprouts seems secondary.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is just speculation, but I wonder if what we're seeing here is
      a case of harmonization of Isaiah with Christian ideas. Or, on the
      other hand, an reluctance on the part of NJPS to use a word like
      "salvation" that has such strong Christian resonances.
    </p>

    <p>
      For what it's worth, the NJPS does not shy away from using the word
      "salvation,", for instance in the following verses of Isaiah.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      49.6<br>
      For He has said:<br>
      “It is too little that you should be My servant<br>
      In that I raise up the tribes of Jacob<br>
      And restore the survivors of Israel:<br>
      I will also make you a light of nations,<br>
      That My salvation may reach the ends of the earth.”<br>
      <br>
      49.8<br>
      Thus said the LORD:<br>
      In an hour of favor I answer you,<br>
      And on a day of salvation I help you—<br>
      I created you and appointed you a covenant people—<br>
      Restoring the land,<br>
      Allotting anew the desolate holdings,<br>
      <br>
      59.8<br>
      For the moth shall eat them up like a garment,<br>
      The worm shall eat them up like wool.<br>
      But My triumph shall endure forever,<br>
      My salvation through all the ages.<br>
      <br>
      56.1<br>
      Thus said the LORD:<br>
      Observe what is right and do what is just;<br>
      For soon My salvation shall come,
      <br>And my deliverance be revealed.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The only verse in which I'm pretty sure there is an unnoted
      Qumran influence is 8.2. I discovered some other interesting
      stuff along the way, though.
