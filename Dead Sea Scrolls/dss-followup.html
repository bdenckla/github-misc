    <h1>More on Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This post is another follow-up to
      <a href="http://dencklatronic.blogspot.com/2012/09/qumran-isaiah-and-njps.html">
        Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</a>, covering some possible
        Qumran influences in the NJPS that were not noted in the
        NJPS.</p>

    <p>In my earlier post, I said
      <blockquote>
        It is possible that the Qumran influenced the NJPS Isaiah in
        ways that were not noted, but that is more difficult or even
        impossible to know.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>But it occurred to me later that I might be able to easily find
    some unnoted influences by looking at verses where other
    translations were influenced. In particular, by looking at all
    verses mentioned in Scanlin, since his coverage of NJPS (which he
    calls NJV) is not exhaustive.</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>

    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <h3>Isaiah 8.2</h3>

    <p></p>

      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">NJPS page 632</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [[8.1] The LORD said to me, “Get yourself a large sheet
            and write on it in common script ‘For
            Maher-shalal-hash-baz’;] and call reliable witnesses, the
            priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to witness
            for Me.”
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [no footnotes relevant to the issue at hand]
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 127).</p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        The MT and 4QIsa-e have a first person future verb for "I will
        call as witness(es)," while 1QIsa-a reads <em>wh`d,</em> an
        imperative form, "and have it attested," as in NRSV. The NIV
        translates the MT (with 4QIsa-e), "And I will call in Uriah
        the priest and Zechariah ... as reliable witnesses for me."
        Some translations translate the consonants of the MT, but
        change the vowel of the first letter
        from <em>w</em><sup>e</sup> to <em>wa,</em>
        changing it to the past tense. The future tense of the NIV,
        however, is a legitimate tense shift in prophetic literature,
        reflecting the prophet's certainty that he will be the agent
        of God's message. In any case, it does not seem necessary to
        resort to the 1QIsa-a reading.
      </blockquote>

    <h3>Isaiah 14.30</h3>

    <p>Here the NJPS is not influenced by Qumran, in that it chooses
    "it will slay" instead of "I will slay." But, in a footnote, it
    offers an emendation in the same spirit as 1QIsa-a.  </p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [[14.29] Rejoice not, all Philistia,<br>
            Because the staff of him that beat you is broken.<br>
            For from the stock of a snake there sprouts an asp,<br>
            A flying seraph branches out from it.]<br>
            The first-born of the poor shall graze<br>
            And the destitute lie down secure.<br>
            <em>I will kill your stock by famine,</em><br>
            And it shall slay the very last of you.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [footnote:] Emendation yields “It shall kill your
            offspring with its venom <em>(zar‘ekh berosho)</em>.”
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 128).</p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        The RSV and NRSV follow 1QIsa-a in translating, "I will slay,"
        instead of "he/it will slay." The Isaiah scroll seems to
        better fit the context in which this passage is preceded by
        another first person singular verb. Among the ancient
        versions, only the Latin agrees with 1QIsa-a. Burrows finds
        the Qumran reading quite convincing (1955:307), and the
        NEB/REB concur. However, HOTTP prefers the MT, explaining the
        shift to third person as a reference back to "the venomous
        serpent" of 14:29.
