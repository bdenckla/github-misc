    <h1>Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A great question was raised by one of the members of my Torah
    Study group: how, if at all, have the Dead Sea (Qumran) Scrolls
    influenced the URJ (Plaut/Stein) Torah we use?</p>

    </div>

    <p>My attempt to answer this question has led me down a lot of
    interesting paths.</p>

    <p>I don't attempt to answer that question here, but I will answer
    a smaller, related question. That question is, how, if at all,
    have the Qumran Scrolls influenced the NJPS English translation of
    the book of Isaiah? ("NJPS" stands for "new JPS", i.e. the
    (relatively) new version of the Jewish Publication Society's
    English translation.)</p>

    <p>So, here I won't be talking about any of the five books of the
    Torah, I'll just be talking about the book of Isaiah. As a
    reminder, the book of Isaiah is in the section of the Tanakh
    (Hebrew Bible) called Nevi'im (Prophets).</p>

    <p>Since a complete scroll of the book of Isaiah was discovered at
    Qumran, translations of Isaiah are a good place to look for
    influences from Qumran. In fact it is the only book of the Tanakh
    for which a complete scroll was discovered at Qumran. This scroll
    is refered to as the Great Isaiah Scroll, or, less dramatically,
    as 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>.</p>

    <p>Here is a quick notational detour. 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> breaks
    down to mean the following.
      <ul>
        <li>1Q means that this manuscript was found at Cave 1 at Qumran.</li>
        <li>Isa means that this manuscript is of the book of Isaiah.</li>
        <li><sup>a</sup> (superscript 'a') distinguishes this
        manuscript from other Isaiahs found in Cave 1,
        e.g. 1QIsa<sup>b</sup>. From here on, we'll use a dash instead
        of a superscript, e.g. we'll use 1QIsa-a instead of
        1QIsa<sup>a</sup>.</p></li>
      </ul>

    <p>Several
    other, incomplete scrolls of Isaiah were discovered at Qumran,
    too, e.g. 1QIsa-b, 4QIsa-a, 4QIsa-b,
    etc.</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>

    <p>So, how, if at all, have the Qumran Scrolls influenced the NJPS
    English translation of the book of Isaiah?</p>

    <p>A short answer is: Qumran is mentioned 16 footnotes. In all 16,
    only manuscript 1QIsa-a is mentioned. (The NJPS footnotes refer to
    it as 1QIs-a, i.e. Isaiah is abbreviated to "Is" not "Isa".)</p>

    <p>In only 4 of those places does the footnote correspond to an
    actual influence on the body text. In the other 12 places, Qumran
    is only mentioned in the footnote.</p>

    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <p>It is possible that the Qumran influenced the NJPS Isaiah in
    ways that were not noted, but that is more difficult or even
    impossible to know.</p>

    <p>So, we'll confine ourselves to influences that can be seen in
    the body text and footnotes. In particular, let's start with the
    four influences on the body text.</p>

    <p>Below, we use italics to indicate which span of text the
    footnote is commenting on. (The NJPS uses superscripted lowercase
    letters and dashes to do this.)</p>

    <p>Below, the column label "c.v (p)" means "chaper.verse (page
    number)". An additional chapter and verse in curly braces
    sometimes follows. This is to provide the chapter and verse used
    by Christian Bibles. E.g. the first selection below, Isaiah 8.23,
    is identified as Isaiah 9.1 in Christian Bibles.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>Influences of 1QIsa-a are apparent in the NJPS Isaiah,
    especially if you consider footnotes to be an integral part of the
    translation. But, like most Qumran influences, they are far from
    dramatic. This flows from the fact that most Qumran manuscripts do
    not differ dramatically from the Masoretic texts. Perhaps it is
    this agreement that is the most dramatic thing about the Qumran
    manuscripts!</p>
