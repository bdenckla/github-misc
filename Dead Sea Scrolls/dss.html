    <h1>Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A great question was raised by one of the members of my Torah
    Study group: how, if at all, have the Dead Sea (Qumran) Scrolls
    influenced the URJ (Plaut/Stein) Torah we use?</p>

    </div>

    <p>My attempt to answer this question has led me down a lot of
    interesting paths.</p>

    <p>I don't attempt to answer that question here, but I will answer
    a smaller, related question. That question is, how, if at all,
    have the Qumran Scrolls influenced the NJPS English translation of
    the book of Isaiah? ("NJPS" stands for "new JPS", i.e. the
    (relatively) new version of the Jewish Publication Society's
    English translation.)</p>

    </div>

    <p>So, here I won't be talking about any of the five books of the
    Torah, I'll just be talking about the book of Isaiah. As a
    reminder, the book of Isaiah is in the section of the Tanakh
    (Hebrew Bible) called Nevi'im (Prophets).</p>

    <p>Since a complete scroll of the book of Isaiah was discovered at
    Qumran, translations of Isaiah are a good place to look for
    influences from Qumran. In fact it is the only book of the Tanakh
    for which a complete scroll was discovered at Qumran. This scroll
    is refered to as the Great Isaiah Scroll, or, less dramatically,
    as 1QIsa<sup>a</sup>.</p>

    <p>Here is a quick notational detour. 1QIsa<sup>a</sup> breaks
    down to mean the following.
      <ul>
        <li>1Q means that this manuscript was found at Cave 1 at Qumran.</li>
        <li>Isa means that this manuscript is of the book of Isaiah.</li>
        <li><sup>a</sup> (superscript 'a') distinguishes this
        manuscript from other Isaiahs found in Cave 1,
        e.g. 1QIsa<sup>b</sup>. From here on, we'll use a dash instead
        of a superscript, e.g. we'll use 1QIsa-a instead of
        1QIsa<sup>a</sup>.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Several
    other, incomplete scrolls of Isaiah were discovered at Qumran,
    too, e.g. 1QIsa-b, 4QIsa-a, 4QIsa-b,
    etc.</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>

    <p>So, how, if at all, have the Qumran Scrolls influenced the NJPS
    English translation of the book of Isaiah?</p>

    <p>A short answer is: Qumran is mentioned 16 footnotes. In all 16,
    only manuscript 1QIsa-a is mentioned. (The NJPS footnotes refer to
    it as 1QIs-a, i.e. Isaiah is abbreviated to "Is" not "Isa".)</p>

    <p>In only 4 of those places does the footnote correspond to an
    actual influence on the body text. In the other 12 places, Qumran
    is only mentioned in the footnote.</p>

    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <p>It is possible that the Qumran influenced the NJPS Isaiah in
    ways that were not noted, but that is more difficult or even
    impossible to know.</p>

    <p>So, we'll confine ourselves to influences that can be seen in
    the body text and footnotes. In particular, let's start with the
    four influences on the body text.</p>

    <p>Below, we use italics to indicate which span of text the
    footnote is commenting on. (The NJPS uses superscripted lowercase
    letters and dashes to do this.)</p>

    <p>Below, the column label "c.v (p)" means "chaper.verse (page
    number)". An additional chapter and verse in curly braces
    sometimes follows. This is to provide the chapter and verse used
    by Christian Bibles. E.g. the first selection below, Isaiah 8.23,
    is identified as Isaiah 9.1 in Christian Bibles.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Influences of 1QIsa-a are apparent in the NJPS Isaiah.

      But, these influences are far from dramatic.

      Some might even call them miniscule.

      This is true of Qumran influences on most modern biblical
    translations.

      This comes from the fact that most Qumran manuscripts do not
    differ dramatically from the previous main sources for biblical
    translations, namely Masoretic and Septuagint manuscripts.

      Perhaps it is this agreement that is the most dramatic thing
    about the Qumran manuscripts!</p>

    <p>Before I knew much about the Qumran scrolls, I expected they
    would have a larger influence on modern biblical translations. In
    particular, I naively thought to myself, "well if these are the
    oldest available original language (Hebrew) texts, they will be
    considered authoritative and thus resolve all dificulties."</p>

    <p>This thought was naive in many different ways.</p>

    <p>These are indeed the oldest available original language
    (Hebrew) texts. But it is far from clear that they should be
    considered authoritative. All they are (though this is a lot) is
    great additional witnesses, to be considered along with the
    Masoretic Hebrew texts as well as ancient translations, most
    notably the Targum (in Aramaic) and the Septuagint (in Greek). The
    Qumran scrolls add to, rather than "trump" these other
    witnesses.</p>

    <p>For example, though they are old, they're not older than the
    Septuagint.</p>

    <p>Also, though age is one factor to consider when weighing a
    witnesses' authority, it is hardly the only factor. What's to say
    an older manuscript might not have been made by a scribe who was
    more error-prone, or more willing to impose his own views?</p>

    <p>Finally, and this one was the biggest revelation to me, the
    Qumran scribes were not necessarily more fluent in ancient Hebrew
    than a modern scholar! I didn't realize that Hebrew ceased to be
    an everyday language as a result of the Babylonian exile, 500
    some-odd years BCE. The Great Isaiah Scroll was transcribed about
    400 years later!</p>

    <p>Perhaps the analogy is strained, but this is something like me
    transcribing Shakespeare, which certainly contains many words I am
    unfamiliar with.</p>

    <p>In this light, let's imagine that the scribe of the Great
    Isaiah Scroll came across the word <em>madhebah</em> in his source
    for 14:4. He might have been at as great a loss as a modern
    scholar in understanding this word, and thus may have chosen to
    emend the dalet to a resh, making it <em>marhebah</em>
    (oppression). He's in good company, since this is what the scribes
    of the Septuagint did.</p>

    <p>This decision seems like a good one. But it does not render the
    Masoretic's <em>madhebah</em> wrong beyond a reasonable
    doubt. Admittedly, this is not a criminal court case, and thus the
    standard of reasonable doubt may be inappropriate. On the other
    hand, to some people, these texts are in some sense a matter of
    life or death, or even of the spiritual domain beyond life and
    death. So some circumspection is called for.</p>

    <p>To me, the NJPS has the proper level of circumspection. It
    takes the dalet-to-resh emendation of 1QIsa-a and the Septuagint,
    but notes it. By the way, an interesting question is whether the
    NJPS would have taken the dalet-to-resh emendation of the
    Septuagint without Qumran support.</p>

    <p>To digress for a momement, a related question I'm interested in
    is whether the Septuagint was under-appraised by Jewish scholars
    until evidence from Qumran "legitimized" some of the Septuagint's
    divergences from the Masoretic. It is possible that the Septuagint
    was under-appraised because it was in Greek or because in many
    ways it came to be used by Christians the Old Testament that "went
    with" the New. Perhaps comparing the attitude towards the Targums
    would help here, since they are ancient translations in a more
    persistently Jewish-associated language.</p>

    <p>To digress upon my digression: Before I learned about the
    Septuagint and the large contingent of Greek-speaking Jews of
    Alexandria, I thought it was "un-Jewish" to refer to the books of
    the Torah by their English names, since these are directly derived
    from their Greek names. I thought, in my sophomoric smarty-pants
    way, that this smacked of Christian influence. Now I (think I)
    know better. Greek is a perfectly "legitimate" Jewish language,
    historically speaking.</p>

    <p>Okay I better stop writing about things that some people have
    devoted their lives to, whereas I have only recently begun to
    dabble in.</p>

    <p>In that fleeting spirit of humility, let me conclude by listing
    some sources I found helpful on these topics.</p>
