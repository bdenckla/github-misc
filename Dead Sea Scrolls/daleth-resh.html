    <p>
      How should one go about writing a sacred text?
    </p>

    <p>
      I mean, not in content, but in form. That is to say, I can't
      advise you about what a sacred text's contents should be, but I
      have some thoughts about the form in which it should be
      represented. In particular, the letterforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      So of course what I have to say isn't limited to sacred texts;
      it applies to any text you want to be transmitted with high
      fidelity, i.e. faithfully. But sacred texts throw these issues
      into sharp relief. The situation reminds me of an old FedEx
      slogan:
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        When it Absolutely, Positively has to be there overnight.
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      So, sacred texts are those where it absolutely, positively must
      be copied right. Yet, historically, they have fallen far short
      of this. At least, this is true of the sacred texts of Judaism,
      which are the only ones I know anything about.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, how should one go about writing a sacred text? The short,
      smarty-pants answer is as follows.
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        Don't use Hebrew.
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      Let's dig deeper into what's wrong with Hebrew to get at the
      more general issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Avoid homoglyphs</h2>

    <p>
      "Avoid homoglyphs" is a fancy way of saying "use letterforms
      that look different." Hebrew is littered with these. A nice
      summary of them is available
      here: <a href="http://www.hebrew4christians.com/Grammar/Unit_One/Similar_Letters/similar_letters.html">Similar
      Hebrew Letters</a>.
    </p>

            By the way, this "Hebrew for Christians" site is an example of a
            something that's become more and more apparent to me, which can
            be stated in the following smarty-pants way:

          <blockquote>
            Some of the best resources for studying the Tanakh are for
            studying the Old Testament.
          </blockquote>

            Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, or just a thing,
            neither good nor bad, I will perhaps opine on in another blog
            post. But I will remark here that it feels a little strange to
            me. But that feeling itself is a little strange, since when I
            step back and think about it, it is not surprising that it
            should be the case. Our sacred texts our sacred to them,
            too. And, while numbers don't tell all, I'll just point out that
            there are something like 150 times as many Christians as Jews in
            the world.

      Okay, back to the topic at hand.
    </p>

    <p>
      I.e., place your symbols as far apart as possible in the
      abstract space they occupy.
    </p>

    <p>
      English is not immune, e.g. one, capital I as in India,
      lowercase l (el) as in Lima.

      Note that I have used the NATO phonetic alphabet, which is
      designed to give letters different-sounding names, a problem
      similar to the one we are considering here, which is to give
      letters different-looking forms.

    <h2>Use vowels</h2>

    <p>
      I.e., embrace redundancy. It is your friend.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>
      The theological question: why, then, was Hebrew used?
    </p>

    <p>
      A more recent sacred text: are there problems of fidelity in the
      book of Mormon.
