    <h1>The <em>daleth</em> and the <em>resh</em></h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Here's what the Hebrew letters <em>daleth</em>
    and <em>resh</em> look like.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <font size="7">רד</font>
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      With that in mind, consider the following excerpt about Isaiah 33.8.
    </p>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10%">
      <tr>
        <td>
          The RSV, NRSV, NAB, and NIV follow 1QIsa-a in
          reading

          <blockquote>
            <em>ʾdym</em> [‘ê·ḏîm] [עֵדִ֔ים]
            [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/edim_5707.htm">concordance</a>]
            “witnesses”
          </blockquote>

          instead of the MT

          <blockquote>
            <em>ʾrym</em> [‘ā·rîm] [עָרִ֔ים]
            [<a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/arim_5892.htm">concordance</a>]
            “cities.”
          </blockquote>

          “Witnesses” seems appropriate to the meaning of the
          passage, and the interchange of <em>resh</em>
          for <em>daleth</em> is understandable in light of the similarity
          of the letter shapes. The NJV also calls attention to this
          reading in a footnote.

    <p>
      This got me thinking, how should one go about writing a sacred
      text in a way that avoids such problems?
    </p>

    <p>
      Or, more generally, how should one go about writing a text that
      needs to be transmitted with high fidelity,
      i.e. faithfully. Sacred texts are just a specific example of
      this. The situation reminds me of an old FedEx slogan:
    </p>

      <blockquote>
        When it Absolutely, Positively has to be there overnight.
      </blockquote>

    <p>
      So, sacred texts are those where it absolutely, positively must
      be copied right. Yet, historically, they have fallen far short
      of this. At least, this is true of the sacred texts of Judaism,
      which are the only ones I know anything about.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following is a rambling set of comments on this topic.
    </p>

    <h2>Avoid homoglyphs</h2>

    <p>
      The first rule of faithful transmission is "avoid homoglyphs."
      Well, really it should be "avoid homoglyphs and
      near-homoglyphs," but that isn't as catchy. Anyway, it is just a
      fancy way of saying "use letterforms that look different."
      Hebrew is littered with violations of this rule. We've already
      seen the issue with <em>daleth</em> and <em>resh</em>. A nice
      summary of these issues is available on the following web page.
      (Note that they show Tsade Sofit and Fey Sofit in their cursive
      form. Their printed forms are not easily confused.)

        <td>
            By the way, this "Hebrew for Christians" site is an
            example of a general pattern:

          <blockquote>
            Some of the best resources for studying the Tanakh are for
            studying the Old Testament.
          </blockquote>

            Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, or just a thing,
            neither good nor bad, I will perhaps opine on in another blog
            post. But I will remark here that it feels a little strange to
            me. But that feeling itself is a little strange, since when I
            step back and think about it, it is not surprising that it
            should be the case. Our sacred texts our sacred to them,
            too. And, while numbers don't tell all, I'll just point out that
            there are something like 150 times as many Christians as Jews in
            the world.

      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Anyway, back to homoglyphs. And near-homoglyphs. To be fair to
      Hebrew, English is not immune to this problem. Or, rather, the
      Latin alphabet and Arabic digits are not immune to this
      problem. For example consider the following characters.
    </p>

      <ul>
        <li>1 (the digit one)</li>
        <li>I (the letter capital I as in India)</li>
        <li>l (the letter lowercase el)</li>
      </ul>

    <table border="1" cellpadding="10%">
      <tr>
        <td>NOTATIONAL<br>ASIDE</td>
        <td>
      Henceforth I'll just say "India" instead of "I as in India."
      That's how it's done in
      the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet">NATO
      phonetic alphabet</a>, which is designed to give letters
      different-sounding names. But the NATO alphabet also provides a
      different-looking name for India, whose standard name is just
      "I," and therefore could be confused with lowercase el. Though
      lowercase el is not a common name for el (the common names for
      el are "el," "ell," and "L"), given the topic at hand, I'd like
      to err on the safe side.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      Putting all three together, you get "1 I l."  How much these
      differ depends on whatever font is operative. For some
      edification and entertainment, I recommend typing "1 I l" in at
      one of the following sites:
    </p>

    </blockquote>

    <h3>Are homoglyphs "wrong"?</h3>
    <p>
      I think we have to let sans serif fonts off easy on the India/el
      distinction. Though the distinction can be made with full
      strokes, not just serifs, I feel that it is not really in the
      charter of a sans serif font to have to make distinctions like
      that.
    </p>

    <p>
      More generally, we can't say that any font is wrong if it fails
      to make one or more of these distinctions. Fonts serve a variety
      of purposes; their design goals span concerns of form, function,
      and the great gray area in between. Many of these goals are at
      odds with each other, and hence trade-offs must be made. In the
      service of one goal, another goal may be sacrificed, or at least
      compromised. For example, if simplicity of letterform is allowed
      to trump distinctness of letterform, then perhaps one, capital
      India, and lowercase el would be allowed to be very similar or
      even the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      That having been said, for most purposes, distinctness of
      letterform is a very important goal for a font. Thus a font
      intended for general use should give this goal great weight in
      making its design trade-offs.
    </p>

    <h3>One and India</h3>
    <p>
      My particular interest is the one/India distinction. The most
      common failure mode here seems to be a one that looks like an
      India. The above sites allowed me to quickly identify the
      following fonts on my computer as offenders in this area.
    </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hoefler Text</li><!-- xxx insert example image -->
        <li>Big Caslon</li><!-- xxx insert example image -->
      </ul>

    <p>
      A Roman-style one, i.e. a one that looks like a capital India,
      is common as part of what are called old-style numerals or
      old-style figures (OSF). In this context, they may be
      distinguishable (just barely) from capital India since they are
      usually only are only x-height. Even then, when mixed with an
      India in small caps, the problem may persist. This might seem an
      obscure situation, but the use of small caps for acronyms is a
      somewhat common style.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem was exploited or deepened by the design of certain old typewriters that did not have a one key.
