Be aware that this page's assertion (quoted below) about Isaiah 2:9 and Isaiah 2:10 is, as far as I know, entirely novel, to put it lightly.

<blockquote>"This confirms that these verses, although early enough, were a late addition to the ancient and more original version reflected in the Great Isaiah Scroll."</blockquote>

In my extensive (though admittedly not exhaustive) readings on the subject, I have never run across a suggestion that the minus at this point in 1QIsa-a is anything but a scribal error of omission.

Not only is this assertion novel but also no argument is presented to support it. Or I do not follow the argument.

As far as I know, 1QIsa-a and the Septuagint manuscripts are from around the same time, with uncertainty about whether one predates the other. Even if we did know that, the age of the sources of these manuscripts would still be uncertain. For instance it is quite possible for the younger of two manuscripts to be based on an older source.

I have been assuming that this assertion uses the phrase "more original" to mean older, but the phrase is vague, and a bit fraught. A manuscript's source could be considered "more original" than another's even if its source is younger, as long as its source's "lineage" more directly relates it to a hypothetical original.

Finally, there is a question of tone. Biblical scholars are usually cautious enough to avoid strong words like "confirm," which used here. Biblical scholarship hardly ever reaches such levels of certainty.

A different, perhaps more well-known, 1QIsa-a variant should have been chosen, and a more balanced conclusion should have been presented, based on established scholarship.

I would have liked to have seen something more like Minkoff's presentation of Isaiah 11:6 at http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-interpretation/searching-for-the-better-text-2/
