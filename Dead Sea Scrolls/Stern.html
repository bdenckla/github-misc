    <h1>Qumran, Isaiah, and Stern</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This post is a follow-up to
      <a href="http://dencklatronic.blogspot.com/2012/09/qumran-isaiah-and-njps.html">
        Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</a>, answering a
      question posed there by Rabbi Stein himself.</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>


    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <p>
      In Isaiah 60.19, Stern makes pretty much the same bracketed
      addition as NJPS, but does not note any sources for it. One
      could even imagine making this clarifying addition without
      influence from ancient sources, but I doubt this was the case
      with Stern.

    <p>
      In Isaiah 40.6, Stern makes exactly the same change as NJPS,
      with pretty much the same note, too.

            of an Isaiah manuscript discovered at the Dead Sea, as well

          </td>
        </tr>

      </table>
    </p>

    <p>In Isaiah 49.24, NJPS and Stern are pretty much the same, and
      neither note any Qumran influence. Nor does there seem to be any
      influence.</p>

    <p>Despite all that, I included 49.24 because it is a verse for
      which Qumran has influenced many other translations.</p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Can spoil be taken from a warrior,<br>
            Or captives retrieved from a victor?
          </td>
          <td>
            Can spoil be taken away from a warrior?<br>
            Can a victor's captives escape?
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>

        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>

    <p>Both NJPS and Stern choose "victor" where others have chosen
      "the just" (Masoretic) or "tyrant" (Qumran). To me, "victor" seems
      far away in meaning from both "the just" and "tyrant."</p>

    <p>"The just" comes from the
      Masoretic <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/6662.htm">
        <em>tsaddiq</em></a> (צדיק). (If you and/or your browser are
      Hebrew impaired, the letters are tsadi, dalet, yod, and
      qof.)</p>

    <p>"Tyrant" comes from the
      Qumran <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/6184.htm">
        <em>arits</em></a> (עריץ). (If you and/or your browser are Hebrew
      impaired, the letters are ayin, resh, yod, and
      tsadi-sofit.)</p>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it. (Note that his
      transliteration of עריץ is <em>`ryts</em>.)</p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        The phrase "captives of the just" in the second half of 49:24 is
        somewhat awkward in this context. The NIV, RSV/NRSV, NEB/REB,
        and NAB all follow the 1QIsa-a reading <em>`ryts</em>
        (tyrant/ruthless), citing the manuscript evidence from
        Qumran. GNB also translates "tyrant" without a textual note,
        since GNB does not cite textual variants that have the support
        of at least one Hebrew manuscript. HOTTP recommends that
        translations follow the Qumran reading.<br>

    <p>In Isaiah 51.19, NJPS notes a possible variant in "several
    ancient versions", whereas Stern accepts this variant without
    note.</p>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it.</p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        This verse ends in the MT with the question, "How can I
        comfort you?" In 1QIsa-a the word for comfort begins with the
        letter <em>yod</em> instead of <em>aleph</em> (third person
        instead of first). The NAB, NIV, RSV/NRSV, and NEB/REB all
        follow the Qumran reading, although HOTTP believes the MT
        should be followed in translation and considers the 1QIsa-a
        reading an assimilation to the third person verb used earlier
        in the verse. There is no compelling reason to doubt that in
        the prophetic style, God would be speaking in the second half
        of the verse. The acceptance by most modern translations of
        this Qumran variant illustrates how an evaluation of
        manuscript evidence can be combined with a decision regarding
        literary appropriateness. This has been the traditional
        approach of translators when dealing with textual problems. A
        new trend, as exemplified by HOTTP, tends to evaluate variants
        such as found in 1QIsa-a here, as just as likely to be the
        result of an ancient scribe adjusting the text in response to
        some perceived difficulty. Accordingly, modern translators
        would be advised to be a bit more cautious in accepting
        textual variants of this type.<br>
