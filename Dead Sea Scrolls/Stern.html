    <p>Neither NJPS nor Stern note any Qumran influence in 49.24. Nor
    does there seem to be any (unnoted) influence.</p>

    <p>Both NJPS and Stern choose "victor" where others have chosen
    "the just" (Masoretic) or "tyrant" (Qumran). To me, "victor" seems
    far away in meaning from both "the just" and "tyrant."</p>

    <p>"The just" comes from the
        Masoretic <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/6662.htm">
        <em>tsaddiq</em></a> (צדיק). (If you and/or your browser are
        Hebrew impaired, the letters are tsadi, dalet, yod, and
        qof.)</p>

    <p>"Tyrant" comes from the
        Qumran <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/6184.htm">
        <em>arits</em></a> (עריץ). (If you and/or your browser are Hebrew
        impaired, the letters are ayin, resh, yod, and
        tsadi-sofit.)</p>

    <p>Despite the lack of Qumran influence here, I included 49.24
    above because it is a verse for which Qumran has influenced many
    other translations. Here's what Scanlin has to say about it. (His
    transliteration of עריץ is <em>`ryts</em>.)</p>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        The phrase "captives of the just" in the second half of 49:24 is
        somewhat awkward in this context. The NIV, RSV/NRSV, NEB/REB,
        and NAB all follow the 1QIsa-a reading <em>`ryts</em>
        (tyrant/ruthless), citing the manuscript evidence from
        Qumran. GNB also translates "tyrant" without a textual note,
        since GNB does not cite textual variants that have the support
        of at least one Hebrew manuscript. HOTTP recommends that
        translations follow the Qumran reading.<br>
