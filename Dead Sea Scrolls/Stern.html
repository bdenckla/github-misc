    <h1>Qumran, Isaiah, and Stern</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This post is a follow-up to
      <a href="http://dencklatronic.blogspot.com/2012/09/qumran-isaiah-and-njps.html">
        Qumran, Isaiah, and the NJPS</a>, answering a question posed
      there by Rabbi Stein himself. How has Qumran influenced Stern's
      translation of the Isaiah haftarot that appear in the URJ
      chumash (TAMC)?</p>

    <h2>Executive summary</h2>

    <p>Stern and NJPS both note a Qumran variant of 40.6 but do not
    let it influence their body texts.</p>

    <p>Stern and NJPS seem to ignore the Qumran variant of 49.24,
    "tyrant". But, neither do they cling close to the literal meaning
    of the Masoretic here, "the just". They both opt for "victor."</p>

    <p>Stern's Isaiah body text seems to be influenced by Qumran in
    51.19 and 60.19, though this influence is not noted. The NJPS body
    text is influenced by Qumran only in 60.19, but both places are
    noted.</p>

    <h2>The Details</h2>

    <h3>Isaiah 40.6</h3>

    <p>Stern and NJPS both note a Qumran variant of 40.6 but do not
    let it influence their body texts.</p>


      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">NJPS page 698</td>
          <td width="50%">Stern (TAMC) page 1223</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            A voice rings out: “Proclaim!”<br>
            <em>Another asks,</em> “What shall I proclaim?”<br>
            “All flesh is grass,<br>
            All its goodness like flowers of the field"
          </td>
          <td>
            A voice rings out, “Announce!”<br>
            <em>Another asks,</em> “What shall I announce?”<br>

        <tr>
          <td>
            [footnote:] 1QIs-a and Septuagint read “And I asked.”
          </td>
          <td>
            [footnote:] Or, vocalizing differently, following the text
            of an Isaiah manuscript discovered at the Dead Sea, as well
            as the Septuagint: "And I ask."
          </td>
        </tr>

      </table>


    <h3>Isaiah 49.24</h3>

    <p>Stern and NJPS seem to ignore the Qumran variant of 49.24,
    "tyrant". But, neither do they cling close to the literal meaning
    of the Masoretic here, "the just". They both opt for "victor."</p>

    <p>Because of that point of interest, and because it is a verse
      for which Qumran has influenced many other translations, I
      include it here.</p>


      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">NJPS page 725</td>
          <td width="50%">Stern (TAMC) page 1252</td>

        <tr>
          <td>
            Can spoil be taken from a warrior,<br>
            Or captives retrieved from a victor?
          </td>
          <td>
            Can spoil be taken away from a warrior?<br>
            Can a victor's captives escape?
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

      </table>


    <p>"The just" comes from the
      Masoretic <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/6662.htm">
        <em>tsaddiq</em></a> (צדיק). (If you and/or your browser are
      Hebrew impaired, the letters are tsadi, dalet, yod, and
      qof.)</p>

    <p>"Tyrant" comes from the
      Qumran <a href="http://concordances.org/hebrew/6184.htm">
        <em>arits</em></a> (עריץ). (If you and/or your browser are Hebrew
      impaired, the letters are ayin, resh, yod, and
      tsadi-sofit.)</p>

    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 131). (Note that
      his transliteration of עריץ is <em>`ryts</em>.)</p>


      <blockquote>
        The phrase "captives of the just" in the second half of 49:24 is
        somewhat awkward in this context. The NIV, RSV/NRSV, NEB/REB,
        and NAB all follow the 1QIsa-a reading <em>`ryts</em>
        (tyrant/ruthless), citing the manuscript evidence from
        Qumran. GNB also translates "tyrant" without a textual note,
        since GNB does not cite textual variants that have the support
        of at least one Hebrew manuscript. HOTTP recommends that
        translations follow the Qumran reading.<br>

    <h3>Isaiah 51.19</h3>

    <p>NJPS notes a possible variant in "several ancient versions",
    whereas Stern seems to accept this variant without note.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>


    <p>Here's what Scanlin has to say about it (p. 131-132).</p>


      <blockquote>
        This verse ends in the MT with the question, "How can I
        comfort you?" In 1QIsa-a the word for comfort begins with the
        letter <em>yod</em> instead of <em>aleph</em> (third person
        instead of first). The NAB, NIV, RSV/NRSV, and NEB/REB all
        follow the Qumran reading, although HOTTP believes the MT
        should be followed in translation and considers the 1QIsa-a
        reading an assimilation to the third person verb used earlier
        in the verse. There is no compelling reason to doubt that in
        the prophetic style, God would be speaking in the second half
        of the verse. The acceptance by most modern translations of
        this Qumran variant illustrates how an evaluation of
        manuscript evidence can be combined with a decision regarding
        literary appropriateness. This has been the traditional
        approach of translators when dealing with textual problems. A
        new trend, as exemplified by HOTTP, tends to evaluate variants
        such as found in 1QIsa-a here, as just as likely to be the
        result of an ancient scribe adjusting the text in response to
        some perceived difficulty. Accordingly, modern translators
        would be advised to be a bit more cautious in accepting
        textual variants of this type.<br>

    <h3>Isaiah 60.19</h3>

    <p>
      Stern makes pretty much the same bracketed
      addition as NJPS, but does not note any sources for it. One
      could even imagine making this clarifying addition without
      influence from ancient sources, but I doubt this was the case
      with Stern.

    <p>Here's what Scanlin (p. 132) has to say about it. (I
    assume <em>blylh</em> is the transliteration of בלילה. (If you
    and/or your browser are Hebrew impaired, the letters are bet,
    lamed, yod, lamed, and he.))</p>


      <blockquote>
        The NJV and RSV/NRSV follow the addition of <em>blylh</em>
        [] "in the night" in 1QIsa-a. As in several other cases
        such as 53:11, this Qumran addition gives the parallelism of
        the verse better balance. However, one must be cautious about
        accepting readings that could have been motivated by the
        scribe's sensitivity to Hebrew poetic style. This is why HOTTP
        does not advise translators to follow 1QIsa-a here, even
        though many modern translations do.<br>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>Like NJPS, Stern's Isaiah shows Qumran influences.</p>
