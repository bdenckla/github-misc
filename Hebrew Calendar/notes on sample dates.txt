The date 3174,5,10 is good for testing since its conversion to
R.D. shows good sensitivity to the constant of 12084 parts in the
algorithm. In particular, if you tweak it to 12078 or below, the
conversion will be incorrect. I think this has to do with the fact
that the molad of Tishri in the next year falls only 5 parts after
noon or something like that.

I feel like we should have a date that is similarly sensitive on the
high side, e.g. a date for which conversion to R.D. fails if you tweak
12084 it to 12090 or above.
