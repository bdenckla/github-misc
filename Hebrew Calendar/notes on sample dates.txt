The date 3174-05-10 is good for testing since its conversion to
R.D. shows good sensitivity to the constant of 12084 parts in the
algorithm. In particular, if you tweak that constant to 12078 or
below, the conversion will be incorrect. I think this has to do with
the fact that the molad of Tishri in the next year falls only 5 parts
after noon. Or something like that.

The date 2994-01-01 is even more sensitive, but on the high side: if
you tweak 12084 to 12086 or above, the conversion will be incorrect.

3174-05-10 was already in the test set of Reingold and
Dershowitz. 2994-01-01 was arrived at by running the following
program.

    ./find-good-test-dates.sh

That program gave the following output. (The abbreviation "psd" stands
for "parts short of a day.")

    (("years:" 3175 "parts:"     5 "psd:" 25915)
     ("years:" 2994 "parts:" 25918 "psd:"     2))

The sensitivity of year 3175 discovered by this process was already
covered by the 3174-05-10 test date. (Presumably 3174 reflects the
future sensitivity of 3175 because of the interdependence of neighbor
years.)

The sensitivity of year 2994 discovered by this process caused me to
add 2994-01-01 to the test set.
